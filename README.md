# LED-music-visualizer
This is my first project using arduino, i made a simple audio visualizer using WS2812B LED. 
the material you need to make this project are : 
- any arduino board (im using arduino uno)
- adressable RGB LED (im using WS2812B)
- sound sensor (im using KY 037)
- some jumper wires
- 330 ohm ressistor
- 1000 uf capacitor


the idea of this project is simple, 
- sound sensor detect and read the sound signal for the input
- process the input (digital signal or analog signal) in the code to manipulate the LED
- the output is the LED strip react to the sound and visualize it in some kind of light show
